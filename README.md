# HouseTrack_MLmodel

# Objective 
'''
This step-by-step guide walks you through building a machine learning model to 
predict house prices in Mumbai. We'll use real-world housing data, clean and encode 
it, and build a regression model to estimate prices. 
By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to: 
● Load and preprocess real estate data 
● Normalize price values for consistenc 
● Encode categorical features 
● Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model

# Summary 
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices in Mumbai.
● Normalized prices from mixed units 
● Cleaned and encoded relevant data 
● Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model 
● Analyzed model performance with MSE and R² metrics
